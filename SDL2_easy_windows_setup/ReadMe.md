# SDL SETUP

__What this is__

This is a simple .bat (kind of) file that aims to make the process of getting SDL less painful and less daunting.

Unfortunately windows is annoying to make automation scripts for in its own native scripting language "batch". I have not tried powershell as of yet but it could be a lot better. I would personally follow this following guide: [SLD2](https://www.matsson.com/prog/sdl2-mingw-w64-tutorial.php#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20SDL2%20download,library%20for%20Windows%20using%20MinGW.&text=After%20extracting%20the%20contents%20using,bit%20version%20of%20the%20library.), rather than using this batch file since making this has become very messy and im sick of testing it and fixes all the stupid ambiguities that windows produces on a whim.
